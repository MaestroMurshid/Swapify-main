## How it Works ?
The Application acts as the Main hub for the Person with the Product to sell and The Person who is there to buy and the ones in the middle with a service to sell. The Buyer will put out a bid and the person with the product to sell will be notified. The person can then contact the next person to carry out the job ie, A delivery Driver. The Seller will be able to see the people who are available that day, at that time and will be able to select based on various quotas like Rating etc.
